## Biography
**Peng Zhang** received the B.Eng. (with first-class honors) degree in electrical and electronic engineering from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), Singapore, in 2011. He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), U.K. He was a Research Engineer with the [Institute for Infocomm Research](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/), Singapore, in 2011-2012. His current research interests include sparse signal processing, random matrix theory, and lattice.

Mr. Zhang is a recipient of the A*STAR Graduate Scholarship (Overseas) from the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research ([A*STAR](http://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), Singapore.
